</p>

This repository contains the source code for **LinkHub**, a modern, full-stack link management application, and the complete infrastructure code to deploy it on AWS using a fully automated, serverless CI/CD pipeline.

The primary goal of this project was to build a real-world application while implementing modern DevOps best practices, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, and end-to-end automation.

## üöÄ Key Features

-   **Elegant UI:** A professional, responsive user interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
-   **Full-Stack Functionality:** Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing links.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login system using JWT.
-   **Advanced Features:** Search, filtering by project, and a polished user experience.
-   **Fully Automated Deployment:** Every `git push` to the `main` branch automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application to the AWS cloud.

## üèõÔ∏è Solution Architecture

This project utilizes a modern, cloud-native architecture that separates the application from the infrastructure, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.

**The workflow is as follows:**

1.  **Code Push:** A developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline Trigger:** A **GitHub Actions** workflow is automatically triggered.
3.  **Build & Push Docker Images:** The workflow builds Docker images for both the frontend (`client`) and backend (`server`) applications.
4.  **Store Images in ECR:** The newly built images are pushed to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**, a private and secure Docker registry.
5.  **Deploy to ECS:** The workflow then sends a command to **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** to pull the new images from ECR and deploy them as new tasks, using the **AWS Fargate** serverless compute engine.
6.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire AWS environment‚Äîincluding the VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, ECR repositories, ECS Cluster, Task Definition, and Application Load Balancer‚Äîis defined and managed as code using **Terraform**.
